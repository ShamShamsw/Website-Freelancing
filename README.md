# How Simple Website Freelancing Can Be

Many people overcomplicate how easy it is to build a website for a client. Here’s a straightforward approach based on my experience.

## 1. Start with a Contract

Before anything else, establish a contract with your client. This should include:

- **Scope:** What you’re providing (design, development, maintenance, etc.)
- **Timeline:** When you’ll deliver.
- **Payment:** How and when you’ll be paid.

An end-of-life (EOL) plan isn’t always needed at the start; focus on delivering the website as agreed. But be detailed in what you plan to deliver aviod making promises you can't keep.

## 2. Get Approval Before Coding

Don’t write a line of code until you have approval!

- **Don't have a computer:** Paper works just fine as long as you can draw boxes you can explain the rest.
- **Create a draft or proposal:** Use tools like Canva, or show a similar site you’ve already built.
- **Get client sign-off:** Only proceed once the client approves the draft and contract.

### Example Drafts (**Limit yourself to 15 minutes when creating a draft**)

Below are examples of site drafts/mockups provided to clients:

## 3. Build the Website

- Use the contract as your blueprint.
- Some clients may want to wait until the site is built to purchase a domain.
- Timelines vary, this could take hours, days, or longer. Using AWS, GitHub Actions, etc., might add setup/testing time (I recomend budgeting some extra time if using these reasources).
- Be transparent about any issues or delays. Promise a little, deliver more.

---

## 4. Communicate Progress

Keep your client updated using platforms like Slack, Trello, or Discord, whatever works best for both parties.

- Be ready to explain technical things in simple terms.
- If you struggle to explain something, use AI tools to clarify it for yourself first.

---

## 5. Delivery & Handover (End of Contract)

When the website is done:

- Transition to an end-of-life or handover plan.
- This could mean scheduled maintenance (up to a set date), leaving documentation for future developers, or uploading the site.
- Complete all contract deliverables and collect your final payment.

---

## 6. Emergency Support Clause

I include a **3-day emergency support** clause for fixing critical issues (e.g., broken links, missing pages, incorrect information).  
*Note: This is for urgent, functional problems only—not design tweaks like colors or resizing.*

Clearly outline **what counts as an emergency** and provide contact info.

---

## 7. Reflect and Improve

After the project:

- Reflect on what went well and, more importantly, what didn’t.
- Learning from mistakes is crucial. “Describe a challenging ...” is a common interview question.
- If your client is happy, ask if they’re willing to be a reference or better yet if they could refer you to a family or friend.

## Final Thoughts

Website freelancing doesn’t need to be complicated. Focus on clear contracts, communication, and continuous improvement.
